 I encountered a challenge while working on a headline for my blog. The issue arose when I needed to  type all the instructions,ingredients and measurmnets in line by line and also to type each and every line for 10 to 15 minutes. so i thought why i shoudn't be  trying something which gonna be time saving and also visually appealing format. To enhance the presentation, I decided to utilize a Markdown table. it's not claiming to be a perfect automation solution. Instead, it represents a  step towards to my automation, I'm eager to explore how I can integrate it into my blog post.

# PROCESS #

 so , I've found the solution on how to integrate the Markdown table into my blog. Utilize the Markdown table syntax, using pipes (|) to separate columns and hyphens (-) to distinguish the header row from the content. Each row should be on a new line.
|Heading 1|Heading 2|Heading3|
  |-------|------|-------|
  |content|content|content|

# My Automation Journey 
as i mentioned before , manullay creating a table was my plan but after that i started to thing about can i do the real automation for creating a table? so i started to google about it. Since I use Ubuntu, getting started with automation was a bit tricky. I felt like giving up, but I teamed up with a classmate. Together, we decided to use Python for the scripting part.As we worked on the script, I faced some problems. My classmate helped me understand pull requests better, and we tackled issues that popped up during development. 

Before automating the table creation, I had trouble with Git commands in PyCharm. i tried to install python but it shows me  There was an error saying 'git' was not recognized. 

**git : The term 'git' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was** 
**included, verify that the path is correct and try again.**
 **At line:1 char:1**
 **+ git help**
**+ ~~~**
  **+ CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (git:String) [], CommandNotFoundException**
    **+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException**

 finally instead of typing python 3.12 i typed python then it works OMG! it felt like I was on cloud nine. ChatGPT was a big help during this process. finally time to test it on my side , i tested and it is working so After testing everything, I felt ready to create a new blog post and put the automation to the test. The last step was pushing the changes to GitHub, and that marked the end of my automation project.
