**Ingredients**

500 grams fish I used two pomfrets
For marinade
1/2 cup shallots a handful
2 sprigs curry leaves
1 inch ginger
4 pods garlic
1 tablespoon kashmiri chilli powder
1/2 tablespoon coriander powder
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
salt
1/2 tablespoon vinegar optional
For frying
1 cup coconut oil
1 teaspoon Black pepper powder
1 piece lime wedge
2-3 sprigs curry leaves


**Instructions**

Blitz the shallots, garlic, ginger, and curry leaves with some water in a blender. I use some vinegar as well, but that's optional.

**Ingredients for the marinade**

Add the chilli powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, and salt, and grind again to get a fine paste.
Score the fish making deep gashes 1/2 inch apart. Rub in the marinade to fully coat the fish.
Fish coated with marinade ready to fry
Heat some oil in a pan. We don't want to deep fry the fish, but we need enough oil to cover the base! ðŸ™‚
When the oil reaches the smoking point, lower the flame to medium, and place two sprigs on curry leaves in the pan.
Start by frying some curry leaves. Now gently place the marinated fish in the pan. Fry on a high flame for a couple of minutes. Lower the flame and continue cooking closed with a lid.
Fry the fish in a pan with hot oil.open the lid after 10 minutes, sprinkle some black pepper powder, and let it fry for some more time.
Our goal is to get the skin to a crispy consistency. Turn around the fish and fry the other side as well. Sprinkle a dash of pepper powder on this side as well.
Fry on a high flame again for a minute before taking out the fish using a slotted spoon. If you like you fish fry crispier, keep frying for a few more minutes. Drain all the excess oil using a kitchen towel
